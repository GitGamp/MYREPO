# MYREPO: Held together with logic, duct tape, and a CSV someone exported in 2016.

Welcome to my project portfolio. This repo contains work completed contemporaneously with projects connected to my M.S. in Data Analytics program and ongoing independent learning.
All datasets will be obtained from public sources or generated via AI.  Neither the data nor the projects bear any resemblance to actual school projects.

Each folder in this repo represents a self-contained project—cleaned, documented, and (in most cases) still under active development. Some projects are more refined than others and that’s intentional. This space reflects ongoing progress, driven by curiosity and the simple act of doing what I enjoy.

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

This space exists to reflect:
- What I’ve learned so far
- How I approach data problems
- My willingness to revise, iterate, and improve over time

It's not meant to be a final product—just a clear record of real work, real structure, and continuous growth.

## 👋 About Me
Currently completing an M.S. in Data Analytics. 

10+ years in data management & governance, business process engineering, project management and quietly fixing things that don’t scale.

Other stuff I know about:
- Human Resources (current PHR) 
- Salesforce (Admin, Adv Admin, PAB)


Projects here reflect both technical learning and a personal interest in how people behave, communicate, and make decisions—especially at work.
