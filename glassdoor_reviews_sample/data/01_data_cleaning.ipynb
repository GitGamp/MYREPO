       "34458    where do i begin first i question the few good recent reviews published on this site as being written by anyone other than management trying to get their score increased i dont know of anyone in any position across the board who is happy there right now mercury used to be a good company to work for in the past 23 years its gone downhill fast people are over worked super stressed unappreciated underpaid and literally everyone hates being there upper management couldnt care less about their employees the raises are laughable and the bonuses are less and less year after year ive seen 3 major layoffs and only stayed as long as i did hoping to get laid off myself so i could get a nice severance and then be on my way hc is a joke implementing huddle cards and high 5s as a way to reward adultsits offensive i send my condolences to george joseph in regards to the way a company he worked hard to build has been run into the ground\n",
